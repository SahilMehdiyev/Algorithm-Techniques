# Algorithm Techniques

**Algorithm Techniques** is a collection of algorithmic challenges, designed to help you improve your problem-solving skills. This repository contains various algorithm techniques implemented in Python, and it aims to provide solutions to common problems in computer science and algorithm design.

## Description

This repository includes various algorithm techniques such as:

- Two-pointer technique
- Sliding window technique
- Binary search
- Greedy algorithms
- Divide and conquer

Each folder or file in the repository represents an individual algorithm or problem. You can explore different techniques, learn how they work, and apply them to solve similar problems.

## Performance Comparison

The following performance comparison highlights the time differences between the **Two Pointer** technique and the **Brute Force** solution for a typical problem:

| **Algorithm**       | **Execution Time**  |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Two Pointer**      | 0.002270 sec        |
| **Brute Force**      | 2.895054 sec        |

As demonstrated above, the **Two Pointer** approach significantly outperforms the **Brute Force** solution in terms of execution time. The **Two Pointer** method leverages optimized techniques for faster computation, whereas the brute force method involves exhaustive searching, which is much slower for large inputs.

## Features
